MissingOutputException in rule isolaser_joint in file /u/project/gxxiao4/giovas/projects/TAllele/test/out_test/isolaser_test.smk, line 165:
Job 18  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
out/isolaser_joint.dlpfc.merged.mi_summary.tab
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
